# Overview
This repository includes data sets used to develop and evaluate data-driven methods for network analysis. The results of these analyses are published in several research papers and theses. We collect all traces from real testbeds (described in the presented papers) by running applications under different load patterns. 

Data traces "VoD periodic - CNSM 2015.zip" and "VoD flashcrowd - CNSM 2015.zip" are first collected and used for the research published in:
1) R. Yanggratoke, J. Ahmed, J. Ardelius, C. Flinta, A. Johnsson, D. Gillblad, and R. Stadler, “Predicting Service Metrics for Cluster-based Services using Real-time Analytics,” in Network and Service Management (CNSM), 2015 11th International Conference on. IEEE, 2015, pp. 135–143.

Details of the testbed and the VoD application are described in this research paper. Later we use this data set for the following research papers:

Traces are colloected from KTH labratory. To collect the traces we run two Video on Demand (VoD) and Key-value (KV) services. You can find more details about these traces in the following pappers:
