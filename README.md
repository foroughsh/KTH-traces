# Overview
This repository includes data sets used to develop and evaluate data-driven methods for network analysis. The results of these analyses are published in several research papers and theses. We collect all traces from real testbeds (described in the presented papers) by running applications under different load patterns. 

Data traces **"VoD periodic - CNSM 2015.zip"** and **"VoD flashcrowd - CNSM 2015.zip"** are first collected and used for the research published in:
1) R. Yanggratoke, J. Ahmed, J. Ardelius, C. Flinta, A. Johnsson, D. Gillblad, and R. Stadler, “Predicting Service Metrics for Cluster-based Services using Real-time Analytics,” in Network and Service Management (CNSM), 2015 11th International Conference on. IEEE, 2015, pp. 135–143.

Date traces **"KV flashcrowd - JNSM 2017.zip"** and **"KV periodic - JNSM 2017.zip"** are first collected and used for the research published in:
2) 2) R.  Stadler,  R.  Pasquini,  and  V.  Fodor,  “Learning  from  network  device statistics,” Journal of Network and Systems Management, vol. 25, no. 4, pp. 672–698, 2017.

These research papers describe the testbed and the KV and VoD services. Later we use these data sets for the following research papers:

Another set of data traces is related to microservice-based applications, such as the open-source application called "online boutique" (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). We deploy this application as our testbed which is explained mainly in the following publications:
